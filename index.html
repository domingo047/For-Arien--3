      <h2>Hapy Valentine's Day!</h2>
      <p>
        Dear Arien "Commit to the bit" Russo,<br><br>
        I'm sorry I can't be there to celebrate this special day with you.<br>
        I know you wanted me to be there and actually celebrate this day with you, <br>
        and I really wanted to be there too. I promise that once I come back we will have a proper celebration. <br>
        In the meantime, I want to tell you how much I love you in this letter and you do not know how <br>
        much happier I have been ever since I met you. You really made my life so much better and I am <br>
        so thankful for that. You mean so much to me and I just really want you to know that. <br>
        <br><br>
        Doing this little coding project made me think of all the times we did literally anything together.<br>
        From the tiramisu eating, to playing dispatch, just buying random things or doing errands, ice skating,<br>
        and even when we go home from work together I enjoy every second being with you. This honestly makes me so<br>
        excited to spend even more time with you no matter how fun or mundane they may be. No matter what I know <br>
        I will want to spend that time with you. <br><br>
        
        I love you so much baby and I hope we get to create even more amazing memories together!<br><br>
        <br><br>
        Love,<br>
        Miguel
