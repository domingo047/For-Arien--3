      <h2>Hapy Valentine's Day!</h2>
      <p>
        Dear Arien "Commit to the bit" Russo,<br><br>
        I'm sorry I can't be there to celebrate this special day with you.<br>
        I know you wanted me to be there and actually celebrate this day with you, <br><br>
        and I really did too. I promise that once I come back we will have a proper celebration. <br><br>
        In the meantime, I want to say that I love you so much and you do not know how <br><br>
        happier I have been ever since I met you. You really made my life so much better and I am <br><br>
        so thankful for that. You mean so much to me and I just really want you to know that. <br><br>
        <br><br>
        Doing this little oding project made me think of all the times we did something together.<br><br>
        Everything from the tiramisu eating, to playing dispatch, and even just buying random <br><br>
        things or doing errands I enjoy every second being with you. This honestly makes me so excited to spend even <br><br>
        more time with you no matter how fun or mundane they may be. No matter what I know I will want to spend<br><br>
        that time with you. <br><br>
        
        I love you so much baby and I am so happy to get to call you my girlfriend.<br><br>
        <br><br>
        <br><br>
